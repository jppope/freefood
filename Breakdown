Project Breakdown:

1) Preliminary Research
2) Validate the objective 
3) Minimum viable product(s) (hack the stuff out) 
4) Testing/ prototype testing => Is what we are doing working? 
5) Data Analysis
6) Iterate till viable product
7) Scale & distribute

Process:

We need to do the initial research to figure out if the thing will work and what is the best way to make it work. 
As of this moment I'm pushing for a single multipurpose drone that can be used in swarms (useful in other parts of the world). But it has been recommended to use hydroponics.
If we do go the drone route... there's a lot of software to write. 
Once we figure out what we are building (which could actually be a couple of things at the same time) we need to build the thing.
Once it's built... which could be the really delicate part, we need to gather data as to how it's working. 
this part is important and due to the nature of decentralized testing we need to make sure that reporting and data collection are built into our efforts
so long as it goes as planned then we scale the thing.


Foreseeable challanges that need to be addressed:
Regulation
Businesses/ competition
distrbution of the food
irrigation/ water
energy
for minimum viable product land to test on
conservative reaction (people worried about terminators)
political reactions (relations with Communism)
fundraising
legal/ risk assesment 
accounting
