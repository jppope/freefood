We currently believe this to be possible by using current technology, and through and open source initiative (we need some help).

This project's scope is the following:

=> to figure out if free food can be accomplished
=> to begin researching and generating assets to accomplish the objective 
=> to build the software to accomplish the project
=> to build the hardware to accomplish the project (or the means to produce the hardware)
=> to build the other resources that will be necessary to accomplish the project (fundraising, awareness, data analysis, working with business and regulators, etc)
=> to make Free Food sustainable and accessable to everyone at the end.
